 A Subgraph is a Script Graph nested inside of another Script Graph. A Subgraph appears as a single node inside the parent Script Graph.

You can add a Subgraph to a Script Graph in two ways\+: create an entirely new Script Graph, or add an existing Script Graph file.\hypertarget{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8visualscripting_0d1_89_82_2_documentation_0i_2vs-add-subgraph_autotoc_md1664}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Add a new Subgraph to a Script Graph}{Add a new Subgraph to a Script Graph}}\label{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8visualscripting_0d1_89_82_2_documentation_0i_2vs-add-subgraph_autotoc_md1664}
To add a new blank Subgraph to an existing Script Graph\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \mbox{[}!include\doxylink{vs-with-graph-open-ff_8md}{with-\/graph-\/open-\/ff}\mbox{]}. Go to {\bfseries{Nesting}} and select {\bfseries{Subgraph}}.
\item In the Graph Inspector, choose the {\bfseries{Source}} for your Subgraph\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Embed}}\+: The Subgraph only exists on the Subgraph node. You can only modify the Subgraph from the node in its parent graph.
\item {\bfseries{Graph}}\+: The Subgraph exists in a separate file. You can modify the Subgraph outside of its parent graph and reuse the graph in other areas of your application. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

\mbox{[}!include\doxylink{vs-graph-inspector-tip_8md}{graph-\/inspector-\/tip.md}\mbox{]}
\item If you chose {\bfseries{Graph}}, select {\bfseries{New}}, enter a name for your graph file, and choose where you want to save it. Select {\bfseries{Save}}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To add an existing graph file as a Subgraph in a Script Graph\+:

\begin{quote}
\mbox{[}!\+NOTE\mbox{]} You can\textquotesingle{}t nest a Script Graph as a Subgraph in its own graph file. \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \mbox{[}!include\doxylink{vs-with-graph-open-ff_8md}{with-\/graph-\/open-\/ff}\mbox{]}. Go to {\bfseries{Nesting}} and select {\bfseries{Subgraph}}.
\item In the Graph Inspector, set your {\bfseries{Source}} to {\bfseries{Graph}}. ~\newline


\mbox{[}!include\doxylink{vs-graph-inspector-tip_8md}{graph-\/inspector-\/tip.md}\mbox{]}
\item In the {\bfseries{Graph}} field, select the object picker (circle icon) and choose a compatible Script Graph from your project. You can also click and drag a Script Graph file from your Project window and drop it into the {\bfseries{Graph}} field.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}



\begin{quote}
\mbox{[}!\+TIP\mbox{]} For a faster way to add a Script Graph as a Subgraph, click and drag the Script Graph from your Project window into the Graph Editor to automatically create a Subgraph node. \end{quote}

To open your new Subgraph for editing, select {\bfseries{Edit Graph}}.

Once you\textquotesingle{}ve added a Subgraph to your Script Graph, define its Input and Output Triggers and Input and Output Data.
