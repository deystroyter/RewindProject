 The Code Coverage Tutorial will give you an insight into what Code Coverage is and how you can identify areas of your code that need more testing, even if you haven\textquotesingle{}t written any automated tests. It takes about 30 minutes to complete.

To start open the {\bfseries{Worksheet}} pdf file located under the {\itshape Code Coverage Tutorial} folder, and work through the tasks.\hypertarget{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_samples_0i_2_tutorial_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md887}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Tutorial tasks}{Tutorial tasks}}\label{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_samples_0i_2_tutorial_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md887}
