 The Video Track sample provides a track capable of playing video clips in \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline}. It demonstrates how to do the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using built-\/in blending, speed and clip-\/in capabilities in custom clips.
\item Using {\ttfamily Clip\+Editor}s to customize clip drawing.
\item Using a mixer Playable\+Behaviour to perform look-\/ahead operations.
\item Managing {\ttfamily Unity\+Engine.\+Object} lifetime ({\ttfamily Video\+Player}) with a {\ttfamily Playable\+Behaviour}.
\item Using Exposed\+References to reference components in the scene from a {\ttfamily Playable\+Asset}.

Drag and drop an imported video from the project window onto a timeline. The video track and clip will be created. The video clip has several playback options, including the option to specify the camera to render to video to, and an audio source to redirect the audio.

If no camera is specified, the main camera in the scene will be used. If no audio source is specified, the audio will play directly (i.\+e. no 3D audio).\hypertarget{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_86_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__custom__video_autotoc_md1231}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Known Issues}{Known Issues}}\label{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_86_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__custom__video_autotoc_md1231}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The video track supports ease-\/in and ease-\/out of a video, but blending between videos will not give expected results.
\item Editing a timeline containing video clips may cause the clip to flicker or change unexpectedly.
\item Looping a timeline with video clips may cause the video to be de-\/synchronized.
