 When running your tests in the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/workflow-run-test.html}{\texttt{ Test Runner}} you can generate an \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_how_to_interpret_results}{HTML report}{0} which shows which lines of your code the tests cover. This includes both {\ttfamily Edit\+Mode} and {\ttfamily Play\+Mode} tests.

If {\bfseries{Auto Generate Report}} is checked, then an \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_how_to_interpret_results}{HTML report}{0} is generated and a file viewer window opens (if {\bfseries{Auto Open Report}} is checked too). It contains the coverage results and the report. Otherwise, select {\bfseries{Generate Report}} to generate the report. The results are based on the assemblies specified in {\bfseries{Included Assemblies}}.\hypertarget{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_coverage_test_runner_autotoc_md821}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Steps}{Steps}}\label{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_coverage_test_runner_autotoc_md821}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open the \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_code_coverage_window}{Code Coverage window}{0} (go to {\bfseries{Window}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Analysis}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Code Coverage}}).~\newline
~\newline
 
\item Select {\bfseries{Enable Code Coverage}} if not already selected, to be able to generate Coverage data and reports.~\newline
 ~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Enabling Code Coverage adds some overhead to the Editor and can affect the performance.
\item Select the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html}{\texttt{ Assembly Definitions}} you would like to see the coverage for. In this example we selected {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp} and {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp-\/\+Editor}. By default, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} compiles almost all project scripts into the {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp.\+dll} managed assembly and all Editor scripts into the {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp-\/\+Editor.\+dll} managed assembly.~\newline
~\newline
 
\item Switch to the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/workflow-run-test.html}{\texttt{ Test Runner}} and run your {\ttfamily Edit\+Mode} and/or {\ttfamily Play\+Mode} test(s).~\newline
~\newline
 

Example test\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{using\ NUnit.Framework;}
\DoxyCodeLine{using\ Assert\ =\ UnityEngine.Assertions.Assert;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{public\ class\ EditorTests}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ [Test]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ public\ void\ MyPublicClass\_PublicFunctionCanBeCalled()}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ MyPublicClass\ myPublicClass\ =\ new\ MyPublicClass();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ Assert.IsTrue(myPublicClass.MyPublicFunction());}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \}\ \ \ }
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item When the test(s) finish running, a file viewer window opens containing the coverage report. Alternatively, select the {\bfseries{Results Location}} dropdown to open it in the file viewer.~\newline
~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} To generate the report automatically after the Test Runner has finished running the tests, select {\bfseries{Auto Generate Report}} in the \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_code_coverage_window}{Code Coverage window}{0}. Alternatively, you can select {\bfseries{Generate Report}}.~\newline

\item Select {\ttfamily index.\+htm}.~\newline
~\newline
  ~\newline
~\newline
 This opens the \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_how_to_interpret_results}{HTML coverage report}{0}.~\newline

Coverage data are generated from the last set of tests that were run in the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/workflow-run-test.html}{\texttt{ Test Runner}}.~\newline
~\newline
 {\bfseries{Note\+:}} Currently the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/workflow-run-test.html}{\texttt{ Test Runner}} does not support {\ttfamily Edit\+Mode} and {\ttfamily Play\+Mode} tests running at the same time. In \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/whats-new.html\#added}{\texttt{ version 2.\+0}} of the Test Framework this will be possible. In the meantime, to include coverage for both {\ttfamily Edit\+Mode} and {\ttfamily Play\+Mode} tests, you must run these separately. In this case, the last Coverage Report generated will include the combined coverage of {\ttfamily Edit\+Mode} and {\ttfamily Play\+Mode} tests.

If a fresh start is required, select {\bfseries{Clear Results}} to clear the Coverage data from all previous test runs for both {\ttfamily Edit\+Mode} and {\ttfamily Play\+Mode} tests.\hypertarget{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_coverage_test_runner_autotoc_md823}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Get coverage by test methods}{Get coverage by test methods}}\label{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_coverage_test_runner_autotoc_md823}
To see how each test contributes to the overall coverage check {\bfseries{Test Runner References}}. For more details see \href{HowToInterpretResults.md\#coverage-by-test-methods}{\texttt{ Coverage by test methods}}.
