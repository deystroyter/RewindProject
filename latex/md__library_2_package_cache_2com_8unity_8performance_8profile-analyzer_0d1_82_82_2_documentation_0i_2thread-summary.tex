 The Thread Summary pane displays information about the threads in the data set. You can use the information in this pane to compare and understand the number of threads used in the data set.

By default, the Profile Analyzer only displays information about the Main Thread. To add more threads to the analysis, use the {\bfseries{Thread}} button in the Filters pane. For more information, see the documentation on the \href{filtering-system.html/\#thread-window}{\texttt{ Filters pane}}.

At the bottom of the pane, there is a summary of the median run time of the current filtered threads with a box and whisker plot of them. You can use these graphs to analyze which threads \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} spends the most time on.
