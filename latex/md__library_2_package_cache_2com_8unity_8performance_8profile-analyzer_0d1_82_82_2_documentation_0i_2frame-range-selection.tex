 You can use the {\bfseries{Frame Control}} pane in both the \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8performance_8profile-analyzer_0d1_82_82_2_documentation_0i_2single-view}{Single}{0} and \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8performance_8profile-analyzer_0d1_82_82_2_documentation_0i_2compare-view}{Compare}{0} views to select a range of frames to reduce the working set. The Frame Control pane is laid out as follows\+:

Click the {\bfseries{Save}} button to save the data as a .pdata file.~\newline
Click the {\bfseries{Load}} button to load a .pdata file. {\bfseries{Note\+:}} You can only load a .pdata file. If you have data from the Profiler in the .data file format, open it in the Profiler first, and then select the {\bfseries{Pull Data}} button in the Profile Analyzer.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{B\+:}} Frame control scale   &You can adjust the scale of the y-\/axis of the Frame Control graph by selecting this dropdown. By default, it scales to the maximum value of the data set. You can also choose from traditional frame boundaries. 16.\+67ms is equivalent to 60Hz/\+FPS, 33.\+33ms is equivalent to 30Hz/\+FPS, and 66.\+67ms is equivalent to 15Hz/\+FPS.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{C\+:}} Selected thread   &This displays the name of the marker which is selected in the {\bfseries{Marker Details}} pane. When you select a thread from this list, the Profile Analyzer highlights its corresponding timings on the Frame Control graph in a green-\/blue color.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{D\+:}} Pair Graph Selection~\newline
\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}(Compare view only)\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}   &When you enable this checkbox, the Profile Analyzer reflects any changes you make in the range selection of a data set in both data sets. This is important to ensure you compare the exact same number of frames in both data sets and get an accurate comparison.   \\\cline{1-2}

The Profile Analyzer uses all the frames in the data sets unless you select a sub-\/range. When you select a sub-\/range, it limits the analysis to just those frames which lets you focus on a specific frame or set of frames. To select a range of frames, click and drag on the Frame Control graph. To clear the selection, right click on the Frame Control graph and select {\bfseries{Clear Selection}}.

To help visualize which frames are in the current selection, the start and end frame number, plus the frame count in square brackets appears on the x-\/axis of the graph.
