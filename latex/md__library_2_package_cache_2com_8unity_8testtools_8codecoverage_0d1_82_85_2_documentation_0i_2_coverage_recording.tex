 With Coverage Recording you can capture coverage data on demand and generate an \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_how_to_interpret_results}{HTML report}{0} which shows which lines of your code run while recording. It supports capturing in Edit\+Mode as well as in Play\+Mode, and you can switch between the two.

To start recording coverage data, select {\bfseries{Start Recording}}. While recording, use the Editor as usual, for example to enter Play\+Mode. To stop recording coverage data, select {\bfseries{Stop Recording}}. If {\bfseries{Auto Generate Report}} is checked, then an \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_how_to_interpret_results}{HTML report}{0} is generated and a file viewer window opens (if {\bfseries{Auto Open Report}} is checked too). It contains the coverage results and the report. Otherwise, select {\bfseries{Generate Report}} to generate the report. The results are based on the assemblies specified in {\bfseries{Included Assemblies}}.

You can also control Coverage Recording via the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEditor.TestTools.CodeCoverage.CodeCoverage.html}{\texttt{ Code\+Coverage Scripting\+API}}.\hypertarget{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_coverage_recording_autotoc_md819}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Steps}{Steps}}\label{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_coverage_recording_autotoc_md819}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open the \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_code_coverage_window}{Code Coverage window}{0} (go to {\bfseries{Window}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Analysis}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Code Coverage}}).~\newline
~\newline
 
\item Select {\bfseries{Enable Code Coverage}} if not already selected, to be able to generate Coverage data and reports.~\newline
 ~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Enabling Code Coverage adds some overhead to the Editor and can affect the performance.
\item Select the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html}{\texttt{ Assembly Definitions}} you would like to see the coverage for. In this example we selected {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp} and {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp-\/\+Editor}. By default, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} compiles almost all project scripts into the {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp.\+dll} managed assembly and all Editor scripts into the {\ttfamily Assembly-\/\+CSharp-\/\+Editor.\+dll} managed assembly.~\newline
~\newline
 
\item Select {\bfseries{Start Recording}}.~\newline
 
\item Continue using the Editor as normal, for example enter Play\+Mode to test your application or run some manual testing. You can also select {\bfseries{Pause Recording}} to pause recording and {\bfseries{Resume Recording}} to resume recording.
\item When you have finished your testing and have collected enough coverage data, select {\bfseries{Stop Recording}}.~\newline
 
\item If {\bfseries{Auto Open Report}} is checked a file viewer window opens containing the coverage report. Alternatively, select the {\bfseries{Results Location}} dropdown to open it in the file viewer.~\newline
~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} To generate the report automatically after you stop recording, select {\bfseries{Auto Generate Report}} in the \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_code_coverage_window}{Code Coverage window}{0}. Alternatively, you can select {\bfseries{Generate Report}}.~\newline

\item Select {\ttfamily index.\+htm}.~\newline
~\newline
 
\item This opens the \doxysectlink{md__library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8testtools_8codecoverage_0d1_82_85_2_documentation_0i_2_how_to_interpret_results}{HTML coverage report}{0}.~\newline
